The app must:
1. Remove background static.
2. Remove noise, clicks & pops.
3. Make the voice crisp & smooth
4. Even out the loud and quiet parts of the voice (compress, normalize)
5. Generally improve the quality of the voice to sound nicer to the ear, as much as possible.
6. To the maximum extent possible, make the voice sound like a different person to the original
7. The app includes functionality to speed up or slow down the audio, yet keeping the quality and pitch the same as much as possible.


There should be optional input parameters when running the app which will give it some instructions on how to process that particular audio.

For example, sometimes it is important to be able to select whether the voice should be changed or not, as sometimes it needs to sound like the original (only made clearer and with noise removed) and sometimes it needs to sound different to the original.
